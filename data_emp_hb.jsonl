It is not intended to be comprehensive or to address all of the possible \napplications of, or exceptions to, the general policies and procedures described. Seco\nnd, the procedures, \npractices, policies and benefits described here may be modified or discontinued from time to time. We will \ntry to inform you of any changes as they occur. Third, this Handbook and the information in it should be \nconsidered confidential.\n \nNo portion of this Handbook should be disclosed to others, except TGS employees \nand others affiliated with TGS whose knowledge of the information is required in the normal course of \nbusiness. It is expected that from time to time questions will arise conc\nerning the \napplication/interpretational policy.\n \n \n \nINTRODUCTION\n \n \nAffirmative Action Policy and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy Statement.\n \n \nTGS assures equal employment opportunity in all of its policies regarding recruiting, compensation, \nhiring, other \nbenefits, transfers, and training, promotions, layoff and recall practices.\n \n \nThese policies will be administered without regard to race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, national origin, \npolitical affiliation, age, disability, sex, marital status or sexua\nl preference. The Company will give full \nconsideration to the employment of qualified disabled persons.\n \n \n \nConflict of Interest and Outside Employment Statement\n \n \nThe Company expects its employees to conduct business according to the highest ethical standard\ns of \nconduct. Employees are expected to devote their best efforts to the interests of the Company. Business \ndealings that appear to create a conflict between the interests of the Company and an employee are \nunacceptable. The Company recognizes the right of\n \nemployees to engage in activities outside of their \nemployment which are of a private nature and unrelated to our business. However, the employee must \ndisclose any possible conflicts so that the Company may assess and prevent potential conflicts of interes\nt \nfrom arising. A potential or actual conflict of interest occurs whenever an employee is in a position to \ninfluence a decision that may result in a personal gain for the employee or an immediate family member\n \n \n(i.e., spouse or significant other, children,\n \n\nbusiness dealings.\n \n \nAlthough it is not possible to specify every action that might create a conflict of interest, this policy sets forth \nthe ones those most frequently present problems. If an employee has an\ny question whether an action or \nproposed course of conduct would create a conflict of interest, he or she should immediately contact the \nHuman Resources Department to obtain advice on the issue. The purpose of this Policy is to protect \nemployees and TGS fr\nom any conflict of interest that might arise.\n \n \nOutside Employment\n \n \nEmployees are required to obtain written approval from their supervisors before participating in outside \nwork activities. Approval will be granted provided the activity does not conflict wi\n\nIn general, outside work activities are not allowed when they: prevent the employee from fully performing \nwork for which he or she is employed at the Company, including overtime assignments; involve \norganizations that are doing o\nr seek to do business with the Company, including actual or potential vendors \n\n \n \nFrom time to time, Company employees may be required to work beyond their normally scheduled hours\n. \nEmployees must perform this work when requested. In cases of conflict with any outside activity, the \n\nunderstanding that TGS is their primary employer \nand that other employment or commercial involvement\n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2015 TEKsystems Inc., All Rights Reserved.\n \n \n6\n \nTGS\n \n \nthat is in conflict with the business interests of TGS is strictly prohibited.\n \n \nFinancial Interest in Other Business\n \n \nAn employee and his \nor her immediate family may not own or hold any significant interest in a supplier, \ncustomer or competitor of the Company, except where such ownership or interest consists of securities in \na publicly owned company and the securities are regularly traded on\n \nthe open market.\n \n \nAcceptance of Gifts\n \n \nNo employee may solicit or accept gifts of significant value, lavish entertainment or other benefits from \npotential or actual customers, suppliers or competitors. Special care must be taken to avoid even the \nimpressi\non of a conflict of interest.\n \n \nAn employee may entertain potential or actual customers if such entertainment is consistent with accepted \nbusiness practices, does not violate any law or generally accepted ethical standards and the public \ndisclosure of facts\n \nwill not embarrass the Company. Any questions regarding this policy should be \naddressed to the Human Resources Department.\n \n \nWork Product Ownership\n \n \nAll TGS employees must be aware that TGS and/or its customers retain legal ownership of the product of \nthei\nr work. No work product created while employed by TGS can be claimed, construed, or presented as \nproperty of the individual, even after employment by TGS has been terminated or the relevant project \ncompleted. This includes written and electronic documents,\n \naudio and video recordings, system code, and \nalso any concepts, ideas, or other intellectual property developed for TGS and/or its customers, regardless \nof whether the intellectual property is actually used by TGS. Although it is acceptable for an employe\ne to \ndisplay and/or discuss a portion or the whole of certain work product as an example in certain situations \n\nconfidential information must remain so even\n \nafter the end of employment, and that supplying other entities \nwith certain types of information may constitute a conflict of interest. In any event, it must always be made \nclear that work product is the sole and exclusive property of TGS and/or its custo\nmers. Freelancers and \ntemporary employees must be particularly careful in the course of any work they discuss doing, or actually \ndo, for a competitor of TGS.\n \n \nReporting Potential Conflicts\n \n \nAn employee must promptly disclose actual or potential conflicts o\nf interest, in writing, to his or her \n\n\n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL NATURE OF WORK\n \n \nAll TGS records and in\nformation relating to TGS or its customers are confidential and employees must, \ntherefore, treat all matters accordingly.

Hence, it endeavors to partner with all parties involved \n\n \nLeaders, Managers, Em\nployees, Internal \nResources and Departments, and External Vendors to support the learning activity in the best possible manner. However, it \nmust never be considered the only party responsible for organizational learning to take place.\n \n \n3.5 \nWe all take resp\nonsibility\n \nfor our own career development by completing the skill assessment, sharpening our skills \ncontinuously, and gaining new ones, as business needs change and creating our own development plan in consultation \nwith HR and our Supervisors or Managers. \nNot all learning happens in a classroom.

This policy is intended to address appropri\nate \nusage for the TGS Internet and E\n-\nmail resources. It is directed at all TGS employees who use company \ninternet and/or E\n-\nmail regardless of whether they access those resources on company premises or \nremotely.\n \n \nAll existing policies that deal with intelle\nctual property protection, privacy, misuse of company resources, \nsexual harassment, information and data security, and confidentiality apply to conduct on the Internet and \nusing company E\n-\nmail.\n \n \nPolicy Statement\n \n \nTGS has the capability to monitor individua\nl Internet and E\n-\nmail activity and to record such activity both \nelectronically and via other means. No employee should have any expectation of privacy with regard to his \nor her Internet or E\n-\nmail usage. TGS reserves the right to monitor and document all us\ne and all such \ndocumentation is wholly the property of TGS. The Company reserves the right to inspect all files stored on \ncompany computers, servers, disk drives, or other media, including individual directories, in order to ensure \ncompliance with this pol\nicy. TGS may use such documentation in company disciplinary actions\n \nHR/LP/Issue No: 5/Issue Date: 1 January 2018\n \nand as requested by law enforcement agencies. All TGS employees are required to sign a document \nstating that they understand and agree to abi\nde by this policy. The management may take such proactive \nsteps as necessary to ensure the security and viability of the TGS computing capability without notice.\n \n \nc) E\n-\nmail Usage Policy\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHR/LP/Issue \nNo: 5/Issue Date: 1 January 2018\n \n \nTGS relies on email as an efficient means of communicating information world\n-\nwide to its employees. \nAlthough email may appear to be a more informal method of communicating, it has the same legal effect as \nother written c\nommunications. Employees should thus exercise discretion when sending an email note and \nchoose their words with the same care that they would use when sending a formal letter or written \nmemorandum.\n \n \nAdditionally, email often contains commercially sensitive\n, proprietary and confidential information about \nTGS. On any given day, for example, company may announce organizational changes, business goals, \nproduct availability, product directions, recent customer wins, current customer prospects, internal company \np\nolicies and strategic competitive analyses, none of which is public information. Email notes among \nindividual employees are likely to discuss similar issues even less\n-\nguardedly and with more candor. In \naddition, email notes among employees may contain pers\nonal information that the initial sender never \nintended for widespread distribution beyond the initial recipients.\n \n \n \nThe Proprietary Information Agreement signed by Employee upon joining TGS obligates him/her to keep \nconfidential any proprietary company in\nformation. This includes email. Accordingly, no internal TGS email, \nexcept that which clearly on its face is intended for public distribution (e.g. TGS Releases), should be sent \nto any party outside of TGS. The presumption is that all email communications \nare confidential and for \ninternal use only UNLESS it is clear from their content that they are intended for distribution to persons \noutside of TGS.\n \n \nIn addition, employees may not establish an \"automatic\" forward of electronic mail to an address outside of\n \nthe TGS domain. This includes, for example, the auto\n-\nforwarding of their TGS email to a personal email \naccount with an outside provider or to an email account that they may maintain at a client site. This policy is \nintended to protect TGS's confidential i\nnformation by preventing the unauthorized transmission or \ndisclosure of internal communications to unauthorized parties outside of TGS. TGS may monitor its email \nsystems for auto\n-\nforwarding.\n \n \n \nTGS recognizes that email is becoming an increasingly important\n \ntool for communicating with customers, \nvendors, and other parties outside of TGS, and this policy is not intended to prohibit email communications \nwith parties outside of TGS. It is intended, however, to protect TGS confidential, proprietary information, \nas \nwell as the privacy interests of TGS employees. Failure to adhere to this policy will result in appropriate \ndisciplinary action.\n \n \nElectronic mail is provided by the TGS India for employees to conduct COMPANY business. The use of \nemail for personal busin\ness is not allowed.\n \n \nA. Only authorized email software may be used.\n \n \nB. Employees may not use anonymous remailers for any purpose.\n \n \nC. Confidential or company proprietary information will not be sent by email to outside world and to anyone \nwho is not autho\nrized to have access to such information.\n \n \nD. Employees found to be deliberately misusing email will be disciplined appropriately.\n \n \nE.\n \nThe email system will provide a single externally accessible email address for employees. The \naddress will not contain the n\name of internal systems or groups.\n \n \nF.\n \nEmployees are to take prior approval from the Practice Head for downloading any software which is not\n \n \nHR/LP/Issue No: 5/Issue Date: 1 January 2018\n \nauthorized. In case of a requirement to download a software which the \nsystem administration department to \nbe notified and the software to be downloaded with their assistance.\n \n \n \nMonitoring\n \n \nTGS respects employee privacy. We do not monitor e\n-\nmail arbitrarily. In certain circumstances, however, \nTGS may review electronic or voic\ne services. For example, system administrators may see the contents of \nmessages in the course of performing their duties. If the employee is unavailable or no longer employed by \nTGS, TGS may access employee electronic or voice mail files to retrieve busine\nss information, or to \nrespond to customer or other contacts. If warranted, TGS may monitor electronic or voice mail systems to \ninvestigate internal misconduct or system security breaches. In these cases, the COO or the EVP must \nauthorize access to electron\nic mail content.\n \n \nMail Access\n \n \nE\n-\nmail usage is limited to legitimate TGS business use. All other usage is prohibited unless \npreviously authorized by TGS management.\n \n \nE\n-\nmail accounts are provided for TGS employees only. Courtesy accounts may be provided, wi\nth proper \njustification, for temporary and contract employees who need TGS E\n-\nmail addresses to perform TGS \n-\n \nassigned tasks.\n \n \nOwnership\n \n \nE\n-\nmail equipment and messages are company property. Messages that are created, sent or received using \nthe company's e\n-\n \nmail system are the property of the company. The company reserves the right to access \nand disclose the contents of all messages created, sent or received using its e\n-\nmail system.\n \n \nUsage:\n \n \nAll e\n-\nmail communication must be handled in the same manner as a let\nter, fax, memo or other business \ncommunications. No copyrighted or company proprietary information is to be distributed by company e\n-\nmail \nunless approval has been granted by the Management. E\n-\nmail massages should not contain content that \nmay be considered \noffensive or disruptive. Employees may not retrieve or read e\n-\nmail that was not sent to \nthem unless authorized by the company or by the e\n-\nmail recipient.\n \n \nEmail policy covers mandatory principles for the use of organizational email services. Anyone using a\n \ncorporate email server or email address, whether they use those services from their office, home or other \nlocation, is using a corporate asset. Employee is not authorized to send mails to a distribution list unless \nowner of the distribution list has grant\ned approval.\n \n \nNON\n-\nBUSINESS E\n-\nMAIL\n \n \nAllowed \n-\n \nIncidental and occasional personal use of electronic mail is permitted. Such messages \nbecome the property of the company and are subject to the same conditions as company e\n-\nmail. Not \nAllowed \n-\n \nNo personal busine\nss is to be conducted using company e\n-\nmail.\n \n \nE\n-\nM \nAIL ATTACHMENTS\n \n \nA feature of e\n-\nmail is the ability to send and receive attachments. However, sending large attachments \ncauses mail servers and gateways to external services (such as the Internet) to run slo\nwer and can cause \nsignificant delay in the delivery of e\n-\nmail. To prevent the degradation of the company's e\n-\nmail systems, \nemployees should limit the use of attachments to external services and compress attachments before \nsending them utilizing WINZIP or s\nimilar products. Attachments greater than 100 KB in size are restricted,\n \n \nHR/LP/Issue No: 5/Issue Date: 1 January 2018\n \nwhich will be increased on request with an e\n-\nmail approval from the corresponding functional head. \nNonbusiness related e\n-\nmail containin\ng large file attachments, such as graphics and multimedia files, should \nnot be sent via the company's e\n-\nmail systems.\n \n \n \nMAILBOX CONTROL\n \n \nAlthough the company does not make a practice of monitoring these systems, management reserves the \nright to retrieve th\ne contents for legitimate reasons, such as to find lost messages, to comply with \ninvestigations of wrongful acts or to recover from system failure.\n \n \nVIOLATIONS\n \n \nViolation of this policy will result in disciplinary action including termination and/or legal \naction if warranted. \nThe system administration should report any misuse of the company e \n-\nmail system or violations of this \npolicy to the appropriate company official.\n \n \nOther e\n-\nmail issues included as part of the company's overall policies and procedures a\nre; Virus checking \nof attachments, Password protection, Archival/storage of old messages, Restricting use of distribution lists, \nRestricting use of \"copy all\" for sending or responding to messages.\n \n \nINTERNET POLICY\n \n \nAt TGS employees are provided with acces\ns to the Internet for TGS business/development purposes. The \nInternet is a powerful global communications medium and must be used with good judgment. The following \nperiodic reminder outlines TGS's policy governing employees use of the Internet. It is not i\nntended to \nprohibit their access but is intended to guide them in using the Internet with discretion and common sense. \nFailure to adhere to this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.\n \n \n \nInternet Access Is Provided for TG\nS Business/Development Purposes. Internet access is provided to TGS \nemployees for TGS business/development purposes. Employee Internet access via TGS facilities is a \nprivilege, not a right. It is subject to revocation and monitoring at the discretion of TG\nS.\n \n \nPersonal use of TGS Computing Facilities. TGS acknowledges that employees may access the Internet \nthrough TGS facilities for incidental personal uses, such as sending or receiving personal email.\n \n \nTGS does not object to such uses as long as they are pu\nrely Incidental uses that do not interfere with their \nwork at TGS and provided that they exercise good judgment and do not abuse the privilege afforded to \nthem.\n \n \nPUBLIC STATEMENTS\n \n \nYou should treat any communication over a newsgroup, chat session, mailing \nlist, or similar service on the \nInternet as a public statement, subject to TGS's guidelines for all public comment. Although \ncommunications in such forums may seem informal, they nonetheless have the potential for revealing \nconfidential business informatio\nn or subjecting TGS to legal liability. You may not post TGS\n-\nrelated \ninformation to any chat group, newsgroup, bulletin board or other on\n-\nline forum unless you have been \nspecifically authorized by the Company to speak on its behalf.

This obligation applies to your \ncommunications over the Internet, whether they are public broadcasts or private messages, and whether \nthey are generated through the use of automated programs or t\nhrough your individual action. Any \ndiscussion, for example, of TGS confidential technology, product plans, product schedules, or financial \ninformation, and any unauthorized transmission of TGS confidential software in either source or object \nform, is forbi\ndden.
