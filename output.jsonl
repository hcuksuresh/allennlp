{"distractor1": "", "question": "Which test is used for inferential purposes?", "distractor3": "", "passage": "As shown in the present study, the selection of appropriate statistical procedures driven by research questions is a critical part of the L2 reading research process. The summary of recent studies shows that ANOVA is the test most commonly used in experimental research of this type. The reviewed studies demonstrate that when ANOVA has been employed in analyzing data for inferential purposes, the appropriateness of the procedure for the study has been directly supported. In light of new issues about L2 reading (Bernhardt, 2003) perhaps more inquiries about L2 reading comprehension should be concerned with the amounts and types of variables that are superior, or more influential, in producing higher levels of reading comprehension. Studies that show predictive relationships among the effects of variables could contribute to the lacuna in the database concerning the 50% of unexplained variance in Bernhardt's (2001) model. Through a re-examination and further analysis of a published study, the present investigation attempts to exemplify the rationale behind ANOVA and MR. As a final point, although ANOVA and MR may be mathematically equivalent, analyses should be tailored to test specific research questions.", "correct_answer": "", "distractor2": ""}
